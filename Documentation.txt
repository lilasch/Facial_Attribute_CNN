Facial Attribute Classification by Lila Schisgal and Phoebe Jeske

With this project, we sought to create a convolutional neural network capable 
of recognizing forty different facial attributes. We did this by using the Large-
Scale CelebFaces Attributes Dataset, a collection of more than 200.000 labelled
images.

The images were previously marked as training, validation, and test. We initially
processed them by moving them into folders based on their classification, 
flattenning them, and then performed standardization using the mean from the 
training set. However, as accessing each image proved to be too large a computation 
load for our system, we switched to processing them via a series of generators: one 
for the train data, one for the valid data, and one for the test data. This enabled
us to rescale and access all of our data without loading in each individual image.

Our initial model was a sequential model with two Conv2D laters, a Flatten layer,
a Dropout Layer, and 2 Dense Layers. It used adam as its optimizer and binary
crossentropy for the loss, as since the categories are neither exclusive nor related,
what we require of our model is 40 separate binary classifications.
